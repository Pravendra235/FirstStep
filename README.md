# FirstStep

So, I'm just trying to learn github and this is my first repository.

The file I've uploaded is a java file that I made based on a few days of learning Java.
It is basically very simple game where you have to guess a number randomly generated by the computer.
If the number is larger or smaller, it lets the user know accordingly.
It lets does not let the user enter a number between 0 and 100.
At any point if the user wishes to quit he can just enter "123".
